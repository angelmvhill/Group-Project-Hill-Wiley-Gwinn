# Project Proposal #
Team Members:
-   Angel Hill
-   Julian Wiley
-   Richard Gwinn
## 1. The Big Idea ##
The main goal of our project is to create a stock portfolio managed by trading algorithms. The trading algorithms would conduct automated trades based on a strategy that we either programmed the algorithm to follow. We can also potentially train our models on a data set in order to create better models. We will also use various statistical tests in Python to evaluate performance, risk, and overfitting of our models.
## 2. Learning Goals ## 
-   Learn how to utilize the functions within various Python libraries
-   Learn how to build more complex but useful functions
-   Learn how to intertwine all the material we learned during class and teach ourselves additional material    
-   Learn how to divide our code into classes to organize it
-   Learn how to work on a software project as a team
## 3.  Implementation Plan ##
1.  Choose libraries to use     
2.  Aggregate examples for use as guides and starting points
3.  Find applicable and relevant articles detailing the creation of basic trading bots 
4.  Research trading strategies in python
5.  Select strategies to use based on the efficacy, profit, and overhead of each algorithm
6.  Select data persistence strategy / technology stack
7.  Build out the initial trading strategies using the applicable libraries 
8.  Record the results and iterate on the each bot 
9.  Create reports using pyfolio, empyrical, and alphalens (financial strategy and performance analysis libraries).
10.  Finalize overall project report documentation
## 4. Project Schedule ##
Our project schedule is divided into 4 sections, each of which involves working on the different points on the implementation plan. 
1.  Weeks 1 & 2 
	1.1.  Implementation points a, b, and c
2.  Weeks 3 & 4
	2.1.  Finish implementation plan points d, e, and f
3.  Weeks 5 & 6 
	3.1.  Finish implementation plan points g and h
4.  Weeks 7 & 8
	4.1.  Finish implementation plan points i and j

## 5. Collaboration Plan ##
We will be collaborating in person for several hours each schedule period to get each member up to date and to touch base as we work. We will also split up tasks to assign each member to complete throughout the period. We will use the agile development methodology with each 2 week period being one sprint. If it becomes necessary, we will use Jira or Trello to manage the workload, should the complexity of the sprints warrant it, but will begin by manually assigning and tracking work. Slack will be used to communicate between team members for problem solving, check-ins, and miscellaneous items between meetings.
## 6. Risks ##
Certain risks with our project include
-   Having unprofitable strategies (we will not be trading with real money however)
-   Creating models that are overfit on the data    
-   Using outdated trading tactics that no longer work
## 7. Additional Course Content ##
Covering logging and plotting might be more useful to our project. Additionally, discussing data persistence in python might be of use, as well as data manipulation and analysis.
